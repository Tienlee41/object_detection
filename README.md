# Fruit Detection using YOLOv11-l

This repository contains the official solution for our submission to the **Kaggle competition: [Fruit Object Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/2425-ii-ait-3002-2-object-detection)**.  
The task involves detecting and classifying various types of fruits from still images using a custom-trained **YOLOv11-l** model.

## Competition Description

In this Kaggle competition, participants are provided with a dataset of labeled images containing different kinds of fruits.  
The goal is to build an object detection model that accurately detects and classifies fruit instances with high mAP performance.

- Dataset: Contains **training**, , and **test** images with annotations in YOLO format (`.txt`).
- Goal: Predict bounding boxes and class labels for fruits in unseen test images.
- Metric: **mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5)**.
